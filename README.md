# Virtual DOM Built From Scratch
This side project was created to deepen my understanding of how Virtual DOMs work, inspired by [React](https://react.dev/).

## Technology
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript extends JavaScript by adding types to the language
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - A blazing fast frontend build tool
- [Node](https://nodejs.org) - JavaScript runtime environment
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - An opinionated code formatter
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Version control

## Features
- Create and render Virtual Nodes using the `createElement()` function
- Render created Virtual Nodes directly to the DOM

## Features In Progress
- Adding Support for State and Re-renders
- Handle Diffing and Reconciliation
- Patching/Updating the Real DOM
- Component Support
-  Simple JSX-Like Syntax

## Installation & Usage
_[Vite](https://vite.dev/) requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 14.18+, 16+. Please upgrade if your package manager warns about it._
